# DrugDiscovery Pipeline - Complete Drug Discovery System

## Overview

DrugDiscovery Pipeline is an advanced platform that automates and accelerates the drug discovery process using artificial intelligence and computational chemistry. The system combines data collection and analysis, biological activity prediction, molecular optimization, and automated scientific reporting.

## Project Goals

* **Scientific:** Demonstrate the application of AI in drug discovery.
* **Technical:** Showcase expertise in building complex machine learning pipelines.
* **Professional:** Deliver an end-to-end, scalable solution.
* **Differentiator:** Integrate multiple ML approaches (deep learning, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning) into a unified workflow.

## Key Features

1. **Advanced Molecular Analysis**

   * Structural diversity assessment and chemical space mapping
   * ADMET property calculations (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity)
   * Drug-likeness scoring

2. **Biological Activity Prediction**

   * Multi-target models for simultaneous predictions
   * Confidence scoring for reliability assessment
   * Transfer learning and ensemble methods for robustness

3. **Molecular Optimization**

   * Genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning for compound evolution
   * Multi-objective optimization with chemical constraints

4. **Discovery Pipeline Workflow**

   * Virtual screening of large molecular libraries
   * Integrated lead optimization and ADMET prediction
   * Automated scientific report generation

5. **Reporting and Integrations**

   * Discovery, optimization, and performance reports
   * Integration with external APIs (ChEMBL, PubChem, UniProt, Patent databases)
   * Compatibility with LIMS, ELN, and laboratory automation platforms
